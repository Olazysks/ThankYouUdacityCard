# ThankYouUdacityCard
Common project for AndroidBasics Course

A while ago, by creating a new topic on Android Basics forum, I proposed a joined project. The idea was to say Thank You to the whole Udacity Team:
https://discussions.udacity.com/t/thank-you-card-for-udacity/535548/12

Till last week, we were all focused on finalizing our Quizes & Projects. But as we are awaiting for the important decision now I thought that it might be a great opportunity to encourage you all to join me :)
I see that some of you already prepared cards for Udacity Team but these are all singletone projects. Can we merge them into one big almost never ending card?

I created first card and saved my project on Git:
https://github.com/Olazysks/ThankYouUdacityCard

There is a NEXT button on the 2nd page of my card. It is enough to add your card and activate the button. And so on :) Anyone willing to expand the project?

Hope we will create sth special together!

PS
Please check if all is working before you submit changes :)

I already gave my NEXT button an ID - next1 (activity_message). Please also do the same while finalizing your part and do not forget to leave short info in the Git commit (preferbly ID of your NEXT button and name of activity that it is initialized in) so anyone after you has easy enter. U can use one of these approaches:
1. Send me your Github username
2. Send me PULL request via Github.
If you are not sure how to do it, I am happy to help :)
